#References
This projects corresponds with the tasks asked in the 1est project of Exploratory Data Analisis
This repository was first forked and cloned the following GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)
were you can find the complete description of the task and data
This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:
* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]
* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.

## Making Plots

To make the plots, run the R scripts included in the first folder "1graphs".
The data will be loaded using the data and script located in "data" folder.

There are 4 plots, named Plot1.png  to Plot4.png which are build using the script Plot1.R to Plot4.R respectively.
